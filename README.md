To use these tool, you need to have an twitter account.

You also need to install Twython: https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/install.html

The files are: access_token.py - this will generate your access token as mention here: https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/starting_out.html#oauth-1-user-authentication

t-tweets.py - shows the last 3000 tweets, EXCLUDING retweets, but note: the last 3000 include retweets, so if 1500 are retweets you will see 1500
